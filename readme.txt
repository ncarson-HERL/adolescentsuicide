 	code for PlOS One.

	These files were not constructed from patient data and are only 
	intended for demonstration of our methods. Files include CUI logs, 
	5 folds of example training data, a file containing data from 
	a sample of “patients” who self-reported past year suicide attempt, 
	a file containing data from a sample of “patients” who did not 
	report a past year suicide attempt, the SAS code used for the analysis, 
	and a modified version of %PROC_R (Wei, X. (2012). 
	%PROC_R: A SAS Macro that Enables Native R Programming in the Base SAS 
	Environment. Journal of Statistical Software, 46(Code Snippet 2), 1 - 13.), 
	that calls R from SAS. 


	Instructions:

	copy patid_fold1-patid_fold5 to the fivefold libname 

	change drive w:\ to your drive

	note libnames resample and fivefold cannot refer to the same folder

	Note data files are merely representational and do not reflect the distributions in 
	the actual data.

	For the sake of processing speed, the number of trees generated by random forests has been set to 1.
	You can change this with the ntrees = macro variables.

	change the macro parameter rExe=%str(C:\Progra~1\R\R-3.4.4\bin\R.exe) to the path of your R.exe
